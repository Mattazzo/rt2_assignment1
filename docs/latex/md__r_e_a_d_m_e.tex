\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Requirements}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
In this branch I was required to write {\itshape \mbox{\hyperlink{go__to__point_8py}{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point.\+py}}} node as an R\+OS Action server instead of a simple server. Therefore I had also to modify the F\+SM node in oredr to let it be able to cancel a goal.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Package Composition}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}

\item {\bfseries{launch}}\+: folder with a launch files to start the simulation both on Gazebo and Vrep
\item {\bfseries{src}}\+: folder with the nodes written in cpp 
\item {\bfseries{urdf\+:}}\+: folder with info about the robot to spawn it in Gazebo simulation
\item {\bfseries{srv}}\+: folder with .srv files to define the services
\item {\bfseries{C\+Make\+List.\+txt}}\+: file required to build the pacakge
\item {\bfseries{pacakage.\+xml}}\+: file required to build the package

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{go__to__point_8py}{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point.\+py}}}}\+: Action server to let the robot reach the goal position. It works as a finite state machine, when a goal position is received, it fixs robot yaw, go straight to the point and then rotate to have its heading like the desired yaw, so goal is reached. If the goal is canceled in the meanwhile robot is moving, server is preempted and so robot is stopped.
\item {\bfseries{user\+\_\+interface.\+py}}\+: R\+OS node to let user command the robot, it has a client for Command service and an action client for Random\+Position service. When user press 1 robot it makes a request to {\itshape \mbox{\hyperlink{state__machine_8cpp}{state\+\_\+machine.\+cpp}}} and robot start moving, otherwise, if he press 0, there is a request for C\+Ommand server to stop the {\itshape \mbox{\hyperlink{state__machine_8cpp}{state\+\_\+machine.\+cpp}}} node, but also an action request {\itshape cancell\+\_\+all\+\_\+goals()} to cancel the goal for the robot and stop it as soon as possible. ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{state__machine_8cpp}{state\+\_\+machine.\+cpp}}}}\+: R\+OS node with a server for Command service, a client fro Random\+Position service and an action client for Position service. When the server receives a \char`\"{}start\char`\"{} command, it sets a variable start to true and the main function has a loop that request a random goal position, then send it as a goal for the action server {\itshape \mbox{\hyperlink{go__to__point_8py}{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point.\+py}}} in order to reach the goal. If the goal is reached before 30 seconds it prints the status S\+U\+C\+C\+E\+D\+E\+ED, if the goal is canceled it prints the status P\+R\+E\+E\+M\+P\+T\+ED, otherwise if timer expires before reaching the goal, it prints a message to inform user that action is not finisched in time
\item {\bfseries{position\+\_\+server.\+cpp}}\+: implements a R\+OS server which receives as request the minimum and maximum value, within choose x and y coordinates. As response returns random x, y coordinates and the heading theta for a goal position

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Download and build this package in the src folder of your R\+OS worksapace
\item Launch the simulation executing the following command in your R\+OS worksapce 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch rt2\_assignment1 sim.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyEnumerate}

N.\+B. Remeber to source your R\+OS workspace\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{Simulation on Vrep}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}
Repeate points 1 and 2 as before, but with a different launch file 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch rt2\_assignemnt1 sim\_coppelia.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}


Then in another terminal you need to source again the R\+OS environment, than go into {\itshape Coppelia\+Sim\+\_\+\+Edu\+\_\+\+V4\+\_\+2\+\_\+0\+\_\+\+Ubuntu20\+\_\+04} folder ( available at this link \href{http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+coppeliarobotics.\+com/downloads.\+html}} ) and excute 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./coppeliaSim.sh}
\end{DoxyCode}


The Vrep G\+UI will start, from here you need to open the vrep scene {\itshape scene.\+ttt} available in this branch and start the simulation with the play button
